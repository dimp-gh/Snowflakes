Snowflake generator
===================

I just wanted to write something Christmassy in Haskell, so i ported my old
[snowflake generator](http://github.com/dmand/js-snowflakes) to Haskell.

Build
------

You can build it using cabal: `cabal configure` (maybe `cabal update`) and then `cabal build`.

TODO
-----

* Add a few snowflake examples
* Antialiasing, maybex
* Prettify snowflakes
